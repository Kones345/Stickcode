                        From a very young age, I’ve enjoyed solving problems and sharing the answers with others. As I grew older, I developed a fascination for technology and the impact that it is able to have on countless lives as a result of human development. However despite the importance of understanding our increasingly technological world, it was not until the age of 14 that I was formally introduced to the concepts of programming in and ICT lesson. I was instantly captivated by the ability to turn ideas which I thought were mere dreams to fun animations and programs which I could share with my classmates and parents. <br><br>This then arose the question as to why I hadn’t been introduced to such an engaging and enriching activity at a younger age. Although I believe that some of the concepts were perhaps beyond my 11 year-old mind, however what exactly had stopped my primary eductors from introducing me to this medium. As a result, my initial idea was to create a medium in which computer programming can be made easier to learn and access for younger children. This prompted me to consider ways in which I could investigate the ideas behind this. This lead to idea for research to collect primary evidence through the use of surveys and questionnaires to find out whether or not schools currently teaching coding in schools and what the main hindrances to young children starting to code are. This would enable me to create a simple and accessible way for children to learn to code.
